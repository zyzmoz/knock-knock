## QA Instructions



This process will help us to keep the tasks on track and also define the next steps to complete the project/task;



1. Check the issue **Acceptance Criteris** on the issue linked to the PR;

2. Test the part of the application where the changes were made;

3. Take notes of every error (unexpected behaviours, errors on the console, etc);

4. If needed, record the issue and share via slack, containing the PR link;

5. Add comments to the PR containing an explanation on how the error occured;

6. If no issues were found, approve the PR and notify that you approved it;



If the error was out of the issue scope, open a new issue, containing an overview(how the problem happened), acceptance(expected behaviour) and any other information that can help us to create a solution.
